# Implementation Complete: Natural Language Media Instructions

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### Problem Solved

The original system expected file uploads to the web server, but Droidrun agents can't use server-hosted files. They need to automate device actions to collect media from the device itself (Gallery, WhatsApp, etc.).

**Solution:** Replaced file upload system with natural language media source instructions that the agent processes to locate and collect media on the device.

### 2. Backend (Flask)

#### `web/app.py`

- ❌ **Removed:** Media file handling code
  ```python
  # OLD:
  if 'media' in request.files:
      files = request.files.getlist('media')
      for file in files:
          if file and allowed_file(file.filename):
              filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
              filepath = os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename)
              file.save(filepath)
              media_files.append(filepath)
  ```
- ✅ **Added:** Media source instructions extraction
  ```python
  media_source_instructions = request.form.get('media_source_instructions', '').strip()
  ```
- ✅ **Updated:** Content object to include media instructions
  ```python
  content = Content(
      original_text=text,
      extracted_urls=extracted_links,
      media_files=[],  # No longer populated
      video_files=[],  # No longer populated
      context_data={
          'media_source_instructions': media_source_instructions
      },
      metadata={
          'media_source_instructions': media_source_instructions
      }
  )
  ```
- ✅ **Updated:** Content dict passed to agents
  ```python
  content_dict = {
      "text": content.original_text,
      "media_source_instructions": media_source_instructions,  # NEW
      "urls": content.extracted_urls,
  }
  ```
- ✅ **Enhanced:** Progress reporting
  ```python
  if media_source_instructions:
      emit_progress(1, total_steps, '🔄 Preparing content',
                   f'Media Source: {media_source_instructions[:60]}...')
  ```

### 3. Agent Layer (ThreadsAgent)

#### `agents/threads_agent.py`

**Updated `_prepare_content()` method:**

```python
# Pass through media_source_instructions from context
if "media_source_instructions" in context:
    prepared["media_source_instructions"] = context["media_source_instructions"]
```

**Updated `_post_to_platform()` method:**

```python
# Extract media instructions
media_source_instructions = prepared_content.get("media_source_instructions", "")

# Build appropriate instruction
if media_source_instructions:
    media_instruction = f"Collect media using: {media_source_instructions}\nThen attach collected media to the post."
elif all_media:
    media_str = ", ".join(all_media)
    media_instruction = f"Attach media/videos from: {media_str}"
else:
    media_instruction = "No media to upload"

# Include in agent goal
goal = f"""
Post to Threads:
1. Open the Threads app
2. Tap the compose icon to create a new post
3. Add the following text:\n{full_text}
4. Media attachment: {media_instruction}
...
"""
```

## 🎯 Benefits

✅ **Device-native media:** Media comes directly from device, ensuring Droidrun compatibility  
✅ **Natural language:** Users describe media location in plain English  
✅ **Flexible:** Supports any device location (Gallery, WhatsApp, Downloads, Camera, etc.)  
✅ **Intelligent:** Agent uses LLM to understand and process instructions  
✅ **No server storage:** Eliminates need to store media files on server  
✅ **Bandwidth efficient:** No file uploads over network  
✅ **Simpler code:** Less complexity around file handling

## 🚀 How It Works End-to-End

1. **User inputs:**
   - "Check out this amazing moment!" (description)
   - "Gallery recent 10 images" (media source)
   - No links

2. **System processes:**
   - Validates all fields (✓ description provided)
   - Creates Content object with media instructions
   - Passes to ThreadsAgent

3. **Agent workflow:**
   - Prepares post text using LLM
   - Gets media_source_instructions from context
   - Constructs goal: "Open Threads → Compose post → Collect media using: Gallery recent 10 images → Post"

4. **Device automation:**
   - Droidrun agent opens Threads app
   - Reads the goal instruction
   - Navigates to Gallery app
   - Selects recent 10 images
   - Returns to Threads
   - Attaches images to draft
   - Posts the content

5. **Result:**
   - Post appears on Threads with text and images
   - Success message shown to user
   - Form clears automatically

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Config required:** `~/.droidrun/config.yaml` must exist
- **Threads only:** Twitter/Instagram/LinkedIn are disabled
- **Optional media:** Users can post without media
- **No file uploads:** Web server doesn't store any media files
- **Device required:** Agent automation requires a connected device (Portal/ADB)

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Q: Form won't submit**  
A: Ensure at least one field is filled (description, media instructions, or links)

**Q: Media not collected**  
A: Check if Droidrun agent received the goal. Media instructions should be in agent goal output.

**Q: Progress shows nothing**  
A: Verify SSE stream is working. Check browser console for errors.

**Q: Server won't start**  
A: Verify `~/.droidrun/config.yaml` exists. Check Flask port isn't in use.
